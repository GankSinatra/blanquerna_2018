            "text": "Most of you probably heard about how the open world Star Wars game from EA Vancouver was cancelled.  This is the 2nd Star Wars game to get cancelled by EA. In 6 years, EA has only put out 2 multiplayer shooters and a few mobile games.  Enough is enough. We need to let Disney know that we\u2019re sick of EA\u2019s bullshit and that they ever need to end their current deal or not renew.  So I ask all of you.  I was thinking we use the hashtag \u201cTakeAwayStarWarsFromEA\u201d and just spam it all over social media.  Only then might we be able to get something done.  I saw what the community did with Battlefront 2 and if we can have the same success, we might be able to do it again.  Thanks for taking the time to read.\n\n\nTL DR: EA cancelled open world Star Wars game, we gotta do something so that Disney takes the licence, I suggest spamming the hashtag \u201cTakeAwayStarWarsFromEA\u201d on social media.\n\nEdit: Wow there\u2019s a lot of comments and I see that people don\u2019t really like the hashtag.  If anybody has any good suggestions leave it below.\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019ve seen some people use the hashtag TakeAwayStarWarsFromEA on Twitter.  I know some people don\u2019t like it but if we keep using it we could get it on trending.  Keep it up!\n\nEdit 3: since people suggested it, I made a petition.  Please sign and post it on social media with the hashtag. https://www.change.org/p/lucasfilm-disney-take-away-or-don-t-renew-your-star-wars-games-license-with-ea",

As if that were not heartbreaking enough, an elite assault force began hunting expedition explorers across the galaxy and many more commanders have lost their ship as a result.\n\nIn total (as of now), a whopping **898 explorers have been destroyed so far,** and the number continues to grow. Evidence of the metric can be seen by looking at the **Distant Ganks 2** kill count logs aggregated here: [http://roaweb20161109100616.azurewebsites.net/Static/AllKills?from=2019-01-13&to=2099-01-14](http://roaweb20161109100616.azurewebsites.net/Static/AllKills?from=2019-01-13&to=2099-01-14)\n\nWhat you may not be aware of is that I, **The Overlord Zarek Null**, have the power to bring **all** of this needless suffering to an end. The Distant Ganks 2 fleet? They report to **me**. They are the commanders that are slaughtering explorers by the hundreds.\n\nI am not an unreasonable person. This assault was initiated for political reasons,\u00a0and though I had to use overwhelming force in order to get your attention, all I ever really wanted was a civilized, diplomatic solution.\n\nPeace is still within reach. For this reason, **I wish to reach out to DW2 leadership and schedule a (Discord) meeting to discuss a non- violent resolution** to this harrowing conflict. Or, you\u00a0can ignore my offer, validating the long held suspicion that DW2 leadership holds a blatant disregard for human life, and stand idly by, witnessing hundreds more die due to your stubborn close-mindedness. The choice is yours.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSincerely,\n\n*Zarek Null*\n\n*Overlord of the Galaxy*",

            "text": "The games selling point is it's beautiful complexity. The new timers strip the game off a lot of that. There is no time to read your opponent, and no time for strategic macro play, only for tactical micro. I really miss those aspects. You only have time to make good technical decisions, stripping the game of it's depth and making it more similar to the shallow competition. It just all feels rushed. This is especially true in draft where you are playing a new deck vs a new deck every time and need time to be creative. People wanting a casual experience will prefer HS anyway, so game design needs to align itself with people that prefer a deeper more complex experience, because that's the selling point of the game in the first place. Being congruent is key. You can't be both a fast paced casual experience and a deep complex thinking game at the same time.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI love the game and am here to stay no matter what and will keep playing, even though it's less fun for me now. However, I do think the huge slamp in player numbers since the timer patch is more extreme than usual. Valve have more detailed data and I very much hope that they are reviewing the effects of the timer change on play and making the correct conclusions from it for the game, whatever they might be. Better yet, I urge Valve to stop relying only on this sub and instead make surveys of people actually PLAYING the game. Yes, that means not trusting me either, they should go and ask the players. So many people here rally behind any complaint that it can create many false impressions. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLastly, I don't believe in giving criticism without also suggestion constructive solutions. As others have suggested I think the main thing this beautiful game is missing is a meaningful progression system. When they add that I strongly believe they should base it on the assumption that games are longer compared to other games, and therefor give bigger progress/rewards per game or make rewards considerably time based. Specifically they should also reward the loser handsomely as they have invested a lot of time and probably lost by a hair (as many Artifact games are very close). In other words, instead of trying to change Artifact to something it is not, reward it for what it is.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**TLDR: The current short timer goes against the games selling point of a complex deep strategic game. Valve should make surveys of actual players to assess such issues. A future progression system should take game length into consideration.**\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Edit: I am talking about the change to gauntlets that went from 5 minutes with 2 minutes a round to 2:30 minutes and 30 seconds a round. A middle ground of 3 minutes and 1 minute per round will be great.**\n\n",

            "text": "People whining about the incoming Cav nerfs need to shut up, honestly. This is a console perspective btw.\n\nCaveira's ability is her silent step, not her pistol. Instead, her pistol has 99 damage despite it having an INBUILT suppressor [lol why can't Echo get that then]. I've seen her outgun people with ARs. I have been outgunned against her even though her pistol is supposed to have a crazy damage drop-off, which I found to be inconsistent.\n\nAs her pistol is ridiculous, people started using her pistol as a crutch. They used her to take on players, sometimes 2 at a time, head on, and win because she just needs to 2 tap one guy, then wait and 2 tap the next guy while he turns in response.\n\nShe was being used as a crutch by players with no skill. I've played with guys who can't play this game for shit, but with her they dominate because her pistol is basically the strongest gun in the game.\n\nThe whole point of Caveira is that a smart player uses her and uses smart stealth to pop up in unexpected areas and damage the enemy team. She was definitely not being used like that in majority of games on console.\n\nAnother thing. Fabian is criticizing these changes, but he plays and lives in a bubble. Nobody plays with a 5 stack 24/7. Nobody plays like pro players. They play a different game, honestly. \n\nHe wants people to drone for Caveira, then hold long angles and take her down? How much time in the round are we supposed to waste for that? In Ranked, we have 2 minutes, and in Casual we have 4 iirc. So are we supposed to waste 1 min 30 seconds to drone and then pin Caveira through long angles? What if she just sits in a spot which can't be seen through a long angle, and just chills there? Are we supposed to let the time expire? \n\nPro players play the game in a way, but it's a bubble. The game is played very differently outside of this bubble. So Fabian needs to understand that, as do other pro players.\n\nCaveira wasn't played against wrong. She was designed poorly in the first place. And now Ubisoft has figured out that her pistol is supposed to be just that: a suppressed pistol. So, they reduced the damage and increased its recoil to make it harder to use her, hence if you want to get shots on target you have to be smart and flank/surprise the enemy, instead of take 'em head on.\n\nIn all honesty, even 65 dmg per shot is too high, but it's a step in the right direction, and for that, I say to Ubisoft: well done. Keep making more balancing changes.",

When Sm4sh released without Ridley, Everyone went to my videos to call me stupid, that Sakurai said he was too big, etc. I finally got Ridley in Ultimate. And I want to laugh at all the people who made fun of me. Unfortunately my youtube got banned for changing my profile pic too much (Yes, ridiculous I know), so I can't do that. It doesn't matter anymore. I'm happy. I just wish Ridley had better recovery. ",

It begins with average men looking in the mirror, their brains confused with thoughts of \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d and \u201c#MeToo\u201d, terms that represent violence and abuse committed by men. However, those traits aren\u2019t portrayed as douchebaggery, abusive or even abnormal. They\u2019re portrayed as present in everyone who identifies as male and the default setting for men.\n\nIf I\u2019m a young boy watching that, my reaction is one of fear because I *know* I\u2019m going to become a monster. Maybe I\u2019m walking down the street and a woman happens to be walking in front of me. I\u2019m having a panic attack because if she looks back and sees a man walking behind her, she\u2019s going to call the police. I\u2019ll be in a cell and question if I did actually lurch or catcall her. Maybe I like sports and have a mental health crisis over whether that means I will inherently hurt people. Maybe I had a fight on the playground over nothing when I was 13 that society has told me to be traumatised by. Maybe I\u2019m not particularly sporty and I go to school every day scared I\u2019ll be beaten, whether those fears are founded or not.\n\nIf I\u2019m a young girl watching that, my reaction is one of fear because if I leave the house, I *will* be groped and raped. It\u2019s not a grotesque crime that happens to a minority of women; it\u2019s normal and it absolutely must happen to me the second I attempt to do something. It\u2019s not something that other people can help me come to terms with, it\u2019s not something that with help I can bounce back from, because it\u2019s the generic human action. Every man does it to every woman and that\u2019s that.\n\nI propose that trends such as the rise in suicide (chiefly in men), as well as movements like radical feminism and the incel movement, are enabled by the recent and inescapable media trend of treating men as originally sinful.\n",

For a full 82 game season, that means 44 wins.\n\n* To get to 44 wins, Lakers need to win 20 of the last 37 games.\n\n* When Lebron was playing, Lakers win pct was .576\n\n* 37 games left * .576 = 21 wins. So assuming Lebron can come back for the next game and the team goes back to the same level of performance pre-Lebron injury, the Lakers have a 1 game wiggle-room of error to make the playoffs.\n\nThere are some problems:\n\n* Lakers have the 2nd toughest remaining strength of schedule in the league. 20 of those 37 games are on the road and 23 are against teams currently in the playoff picture, including the Warriors 3x, Rockets and Bucks 2x, and a game against the Raptors.\n\n* The .533 barrier for entry into the West playoffs may probably go higher considering the Jazz and Spurs are surging. \n\n* Rondo is also out\n\n* Lebron probably won't be playing at 100% when he comes back.\n\nSo idk... I've been a Laker fan since the mid-90s and I was elated by Lebron's move to LA... but the outlook seems grim.\n\nNo one even knows when he's coming back, but do folks still think that Lebron can will the Lakers into the playoffs despite increasingly tough odds stacking up against the team in his absence?",

            "text": "Hello everyone I hope you're all doing well. I know I'm super late to this party but here's my thoughts of the Last Jedi if anyone cares to read what I think\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I thought was odd in TLJ:\n\n\\- First Order lost their super weapon in TFA. Suddenly they're super charged.\n\n\\- Hux goes from Space Hitler to Space Clown.\n\n\\- Hinted Finn and Rey romance disregarded.\n\n\\- Shooting at a empty Rebel base instead of escaping Rebel ships.\n\n\\- Rose and Finn romance rushed.\n\n\\- Phasma being useless again.\n\n\\- No Snoke identity reveal.\n\n\\- Leia's space floating should have been reworked to look more fluid and realistic.\n\n\\- Cheesy humour.\n\n\\- First Order goons yelling and being angry most of the time.\n\n\\- Messy pacing, three separate story lines at once. ( Space chase, Spy mission , Force Users )\n\n\\- Depressed Luke ( would be better without alien tit scene )\n\n\\- Backstory behind Kylo and Luke is weak.\n\n\\- Rey's lightsaber practice and stance are wrong. ( there's a video showing proper stances - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irvU09MM-l4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irvU09MM-l4)  )\n\n\\- Kylo's grandpa pants. ( Why not normal pants? )\n\n\\- No Knights Of Ren in sight.\n\n\\- Holdo claims she knows how people like Poe are, trouble makers. So why trigger him, why not calm him down? Years of military and discipline experience might teach a person that.\n\n\\- The Throne lightsaber duel choreography is a bit messy in some parts, two dagger man loses one dagger somehow, very fast paced to cover up mistakes. ( Now bear with me, it's not as hollywood over the top as Prequel fights, but those at least had really good choreography. Ep 3 fight is the best in the series :D )\n\n\\- Snoke's escape craft not seen. (If it's just an escape pod that's alright. But missed chance for a really cool battleship, for Rey to come in guns blazing and tricking the First Order.)\n\n\\- The ending is on a happy hopeful note. After losing virtually every last piece of the Resistance. ( I guess I'm just more emotional than the characters in the movie. )\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome of my suggestions:\n\n\\- Shorten the space chase\n\n\\- Make the casino planet more serious but shorter.\n\n\\- Extend Luke,Rey and Kylo scenes. Adding in longer flashbacks on The New Republic.\n\n\\- Instead of Yoda, Anakin appears to Luke.\n\n\\- Replace cheesy humour with Force Awakens style humour.\n\n\\- Ending on a sad note and atmosphere.\n\n\\- Maybe bring in some of the other factions in the galaxy? Mandalorian Empire? Chiss Ascendancy? What's left of the Republic?\n\nMovie looks really wonderful aesthetically. From my subjective point of view I'd give it a 5/10. Had potential but went too far in the wrong places. Extra point for at least not being a rehash of Empire Strikes Back. Also just for the sake of giving Rian a break, JJ Abrams setup TFA in a setting that\u2019s just the OT rehashed, world build wise.\n\nI would have loved it if after ROTJ the galaxy was split into multiple factions, so each hero was from a different faction. Maybe like if Poe was a exiled Mando, Finn staying a run away Stormtrooper,Rose maybe a Chiss spy or something like that. Game Of Thrones style Star Wars trilogy if you catch my drift.  I really loved the politics in the prequels I think they can make it work better in the sequels.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd yes I do not hate Jar Jar...Anyone else not hate the guy? ;\\_;\n\nP.S: About the thumbnail at the beginning of the post, I didn't put it there intentionally its from the YouTube video link.",

We\u2019re not *that* stupid..\n\nPeople don\u2019t come to this sub because they want to read MSM articles... \nCan we do something about this, moderators?",

            "text": "All that is left to do is complete a new game + on ultimate and I'm done. I'm keeping those achievments for shortly before the next title comes out, so tjat the story and gameplay stays fresh in my mind before playing the second title, if there will be one. All trophies, all collectibles, I went through everything, including DLCs. \n\nThe game is AWESOME! Proof therefor is that this is the first game I have completed on 100% (still need to do the same for GoW, got interrupted by smash ultimate release) \n\nHOWEVER! Having said that, there is some nitpicking that I do have to make. If you just enjoy the game and want to have fun and leave aside side missions and content, the game is just amazing, immersion and story are topnotch and can easily compete with GoW and TLOU. But the additional content, side missions and collectibles... \nMan that stuff almost got me burned out. \nI swear, I could smack the guy who invented Screwball. The only reason I kept doing her challenges in the DLC was because I just wanted to put that piece of annoying garbage behind bars. And I hoped I eould get the chance to actually hit her right in her face. \n\nThe challenges are sooo rigid (I initially wanted to even get ultimate in all challenges but gave up in the end) stealth and drone challenges or screwballs bomb hunt challenges are just the worst. Way to give a player PTSD while playing a videogame. When a challenge becomes so difficult that you know that one single little mistake is going to cost you the score and you immediately restart the challenge, that's when you're asking a little bit too much imo. I know it's to get ultimate but sometimes just missing one perfect point launch or even the game deciding that you will pull yoyrself towards a point launch point that is off screen instead of one in the middle of your screen will cost you the whole run. \nIf it requires you to be that precise, but the game doesn't allow for such pin point precision, you shouldn't ask it from us. Same for Taskmaster's drone challenges, ehich is something that will lead me to the next point.\n\nI loved ( and still do) the webslinging. It is the most satisfying feeling I have ever felt in a video game. At least whe  it comes to purely traveling. I hardly ever fast traveled in this game and only did it to get the trophy in the end. I had finished the game and still had not fast traveled 5 times. Even if my target is 3000m away I just make it a race to get there as fast as possible (especially if accprdong to the mission/story, spidey is supposed to hurry, even though we know we could be doing side missions before going there). \nBut those stupid challenges actually draw out and shoe the flaws of the webslinging which actually made me sad. I went from: this is the BEST! To thinking: well when you need precise movements like slinging through rings (superman 64 PTSD coming back), you realize how the slinging is not as precise. When the game restricts your freedom in terms of which route you should take and asks you to pass through certain points, you start being more careful and aware of hoe the webslinging doesn't always take you where you want and I thibk it was a terrible idea to include modes that show this weakness. If it were not for drone challenges or bomb challenges put around 10 million possible point launches, I would never have noticed this 'flaw'. Don't misunderstand, I still love it, but I hate that the game showed me this flaw in the first place. \n\nUltimate difficulty: I have played all the DLCs in ultimate difficulty... honestly? It's not fun. In that regard I will make the same criticism than I did with GoW: the last difficulty level is a challenge, yes, but it is actually not fun to do. It is a chore for a completionist. Did I die? Yes, it did happen but I don't mind that. What I did mind is that I play a bad ass like Spidey or Kratos and I have to play around like Mr. Satan. You have to be way to cautious to even enjoy the game. Do you want to sneak in like a lil b**** when you play as Kratos? No! You want to go boot first into your oponents faces! You don't want to play splinter Cell when you play GoW. Or holding your shield up for 2h, get one hit, then keep your guard back up. \n\nIt might not be the same for spidey, but when the common thug can 2 shot you while you need a 20-25hit combo to get them down.... it looks like all the enemies are superhumans and you're the only human in the universe. Yes you can use mods and stuff to one hit them while being prone to being one shot as well. But it is not a passive, so you always have to keep your distance until you have that power back up. Also the sheer amount of spam in ultimate is ridiculous. While you dodge one attack, you are not entirely invulnerable, so you'll get hit by the other 20 guys holding a machine gun, a gatling gun, jetpack shields, snipers that suddenly pop out of nowhere even though you took em all out before coming out of stealth approach, rocket launchers and those basterds that don't even care if they're gonna blow themselves up or their buddies. \nI can't tell you how many times I almost died while dodging because of the sheer spam that ultimate is. I finsihed the DLCs in ultimate but honestly? If I had the choice I wouldn't ever play that difficulty again. Spectacular seems like the right balance for me, I can chain in my combos, get some nice stuff going but if I'm not careful I do die pretty fast as well. \n\nAnyway, it sounds like the game is terrible but really not. I could only recommend it to anyone. However I would recommend that if you're not into 100% completionism, don't do it, it doesn't improve the experience imo. People might disagree and I'm okay with that, afterall this is not a law, it is based on my opinion and is thus subjective. \n\nIf anyone agrees or disagrees, I would gladly hear your comments and opinions. Just try keeping spoilers out just in case! Or at least gice a warning! \n\n\nTL;DR: Spiderman PS4 is awesome! But the side missions often showed flaws or weaknesses of the game instead of improving or giving additional value to the game and I would suggest to people that are not in a completionist mindset to not force themselves to play it all. Focusing on main stories is more than enough to call this a nice and worthy game. \nMy main complaints are regarding challenges focusing on precision webslinging that show the weaknesses of webslinging although it would otherwise feel perfect and the ultimate difficulty which, imo is not the best way to play, even if you're looking for a challenge. \n\n",

I always rolled one in the older FF games and I loved it in the FF11 implementation; with that being said I was quite happy to hear about blu at first. After getting more info and seeing streamers breeze through 1-50 I'm really puzzled by blu and I'm hoping someone can explain the point of it's implementation. So Blu cannot do any matchmaking.... at first I made a twisted face with confusion but then I figured it's fine we'll just create a party and do everything.. they just don't want Blu's joining random parties for some reason 'shrug' w/e.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut now I'm hearing that Blu will never hit max level it will always be behind. This part is very puzzling to me because even if Blu is just some content... it doesn't seem like a lot of content. Once you get all the cool skills you want... you basically use your blu in 1 dungeon? The Carnival? That... just seems really bad to me. It seems that the only enjoyment out of Blu is the leveling experiencing and then doing one endgame dungeon that expands over time. Is this true about Blu never hitting cap level and if not, is blu's only point  to do the Carnival and they will never be able to do Eureka or Raids? This just seems really bad and I have to say that this is the first time that I have been truly disappointed with SE.",

            "text": "So. Context. I used to be a regular here but gave it up when it was taken over by people who hate truth. Debating people who do not click sources is just maddening. Let's just make that 100% clear. axolotl\\_peyotl's [sticky](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/af839i/vaccines_do_cause_autism_according_to_provaccine/) makes me mad and he should be ashamed. He's either an absolute idiot or deliberately misleading us to help make the rich richer. And funny enough, his sticky has no sources. It's tabloid bullshit. Let's begin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Step 1:** The post itself makes crazy claims with no evidence to back them up whatsoever. All we get is a story about Zimmerman with no supporting evidence. Alarm bells are going off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Step 2:** Try to find supporting evidence about Zimmerman and find [this article](https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/425061-how-a-pro-vaccine-doctor-reopened-debate-about-link-to-autism) about it. But wait... that's written by Sharyl Attkisson who is the same person as in those two videos. Coincidence?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Step 3:** Read the article. Check all her sources. [Every](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vaccines-and-autism-a-new-scientific-review/) [single](https://sharylattkisson.com/2016/11/27/what-the-news-isnt-saying-about-vaccine-autism-studies/) [one](https://sharylattkisson.com/2019/01/06/dr-andrew-zimmermans-full-affidavit-on-alleged-link-between-vaccines-and-autism-that-u-s-govt-covered-up/) [of](http://fullmeasure.news/news/cover-story/the-vaccination-debate) [them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZFPpHBNp2M) [is](https://sharylattkisson.com/2018/12/10/cdc-possibility-that-vaccines-rarely-trigger-autism/) [actually](https://sharylattkisson.com/cdc-possibility-that-vaccines-rarely-trigger-autism) [also](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/learning-from-a-previous-vaccine-autism-case/) [her](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vaccine-case-an-exception-or-a-precedent/). Clearly she's creating fake proof here, hoping that we won't click on her sources. You'll also notice that her sources have no sources or they're also just linking to herself. She's optimizing SEO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Step 4:** As a conspiratard I ask myself... Who stands to gain from the anti-vax movement? Why (libertarian) republicans of course! By creating an attitude of \"science is fake, doctors aren't to be trusted\" we will have more people who believe they don't need insurance and don't need doctors. They will see Obamacare as theft and rally against it and any other public health care. The poor will not trust doctors and opt out of things like downs syndrome tests because they believe it's bullshit. (\\*) The poor get poorer. Destroy the safety net. And when the poor can't afford to get tested for autoimmune diseases then they're just CREATING more complications with vaccines. It's brilliant!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Step 5:** Is there any truth to the anti-vaxer's statements? Yes, one big part. The government does pay out our tax dollars for damages done from vaccinations. [Lots of dollars](https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/vaccine-compensation/data/monthly-stats-january-2019.pdf). Average settlement is over $590k which tells me the damage is real. Very real. BUT that pdf also includes the statistics of how often damage happens: 1 in a million shots. And I bet you that the government has done the cost-benefit analysis and knows exactly the price that we'd pay if we didn't have vaccines (ridiculous amounts of death) and they're okay with paying out for damages in the case when a baby has a rare autoimmune disease and has a complication. These vaccines are already 99.9999% safe, can you imagine the cost to get an additional 9 on there? And it would save the government only $22m/yr! It's business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKnow you're being played, /r/conspiracy. Vaccines aren't causing the spike in autism, better diagnosis is. Look at the numbers in that PDF and understand that they're very very small compared to the amount of autism that we see. Know that if your child has an autoimmune disease THEN you should delay or cancel vaccines. But you know what? If you read up on the vaccine schedule and the cases when it's altered [you'd already know that](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/contraindications.html). And more importantly so will your doctor. Especially if you have insurance and get your kids tested for everything. **Knowledge is power.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(\\*) This is especially personal for me because I'm expecting my first child and my sister in law is an anti-vaxer. She's spacing them out and (understandably) having a hard time finding a doctor who will do it. Her friend refused the downs syndrome test (they just don't believe in medicine) and now has a child with downs. My unborn child has been tested for everything under the sun and she's going to be beyond healthy. Because I'm trusting in science, I'm making sure that she's tested for autoimmune diseases to make sure a crazy complication with vaccines does not happen.",

            "text": "The game isn't actually bad, but nothing great either. It is announced as a fan favorite so it triggered my interests. My last \"Tales\" game is Tales of The Abyss, so it's been quite a while.\n\nNow I played Tales of Fantasia on the Snes, Tales of Symphonia on the Game Cube, Tales of The Abyss on the PS2. I loved the games at the time, so I figured I would love a newer version of it.\n\n----\n\nHowever, Vesperia is pretty much the same thing as the Abyss. By that I mean, very basic 3D animation during cutscenes, voice-overs are pretty bland too, Japanese and English versions. Drawing quality during Skits are pretty rough around the edges. I mean, that was the time to shine with easy to make art, but it looks like a rushed out bland weekly manga most of the time.\n\nI'm 7 hours in, and pretty much nothing happened story-wise. Yeah of course lots of \"action\" happens, but no payoff or nothing that really makes me want to push through.\n\nLots of interesting gameplay ideas, with the cooking but damn it, limiting the food items to 15 makes me need to restock too much, and during a dungeon I'm just done after that. I guess eventually I'll get more recipes but right now...\n\nSynthetesis is interesting too, nothing exceptional but it makes me want to grind for better stuff. The skill learning however sucks at the early game. Why do every goddam characters get the backstep early game BESIDES the only one with a combo over 2 hits?!\n\nTalking combat, I tried playing some other characters beside the main guy, but spellcasting is pretty boring since all you do is pick a target and mash B for quicker casting. Fighting with anyone else than main guy locks you down to a 2-hit combo+Arte.\n\nWhen you get hit, you stagger and get interupted. When surrounded, you pretty much end up locked down until the badguys decide to stop hitting. Blocking is not responsive and since monsters barely (if ever) have tells, you pretty much need to start blocking at random just in case the baddie decides to attack. You can't reposition during a block until you get backstep (Which Main Guy still doesnt have while both spellcasters do...).\n\n**EDIT:** It seems MC should have backstep, but I missed that one weapon that gave it and am now locked out of it until I get access to the starting area of the game once more. Eventually.\n\nI mean, I know you shouldn't be handed all the skills right off the bat and you should deserve some, and feel your progression... but locking away some very basic skills even after 7 hours of game is pretty intense. \n\nMaybe games like Dark Souls, Bloodborne and Nioh spoiled me over good combat mechanics, but hell lots of other games manage to pull it off like Zelda BoTW.\n\nI guess I need to view this game like less of a A-JRPG and more like a Turn-based JRPG where I decide to commit into attacking and get whiped back after, or blocking for a while. I hope some skills come later on to make blocking more reactive, like removing the stagger from the first hit you take in order to decide to block or something.\n\n-----\n\nOh well, that was quite a rant, but :\n\n**TLDR:** Story is bland, plot is all over the place, has no impact, even after over 7 hours in. Combat is clunky, cutscene animations are \"rigid\". However, the game is just fun enough to keep me playing and hope for some plot to become interesting.",
