It always goes to the receptionist first as she has to check in all deliveries. So one day she calls me up, says I have a gift at the front, so I head downstairs. I go to grab them and she asks me to wait and back up so she can get the perfect picture of them. I was confused but I let her take a pic because they were beautiful.  I see on her snap chat she took a pic of them captioning it \"thanks so much babe I LOVE the flowers\". I mean whatever, that's pathetic but who cares. Shes known to do that all the time (take pics of other peoples cars, jewelry, etc and claim it as her own on social media) \n\nAnywho, I get another call months later for a gift at the front. Now this time I go down and she is a PICKING OUT THE FLOWERS SHE DOESN'T LIKE!  I ask her what the hell she is doing and she says she wants to take another pic but doesn't really like the arrangement this time and maybe next time he should just get roses?! I snatched the flowers away and told her off because.. wow. Maybe buy your own flowers then? After writing this out, it seems pretty stupid to get as heated as I did at that moment but I was so shocked she didnt find anything wrong with what she was doing. I've been wanting to rant about that for a while lol ",

            "text": "We are in the middle of the Polar Vortex. I got a phone call last night saying that I didn't have to come in to work the next day, which is awesome because my boyfriend also has the day off.\n\nWe decided to get a little tipsy, play some video games, and enjoy being indoors. Well, once we got liquored up we decided that it was sexy time and we went to the bedroom, where we had the lights partially dimmed. I was ready to get laid, because, well, I wanted to. So I told my boyfriend to grab the lube while I climbed on top of him.\n\nThe bottle of lube has one of those tops that you push down on one end, and the other end pops up so you can dispense it [like this](https://i.imgur.com/llIJq5V.jpg). I was on top of him, and this is where our drunk-asses fucked up.\n\nBecause he was holding the bottle of lube it's right way up, all the liquid was towards the bottom and no where near the lid. He squeezed the bottle hard to try and get the liquid out, but since he didn't turn it sideways, it didn't work. Again, we were drunk, so shit happens.\n\nWhile he was squeezing the hell out of the bottle, he had it held directly to my labia/clit for the product to come out right where we needed it. He couldn't get any lube to come out, so when he released the bottle, my labia and part of my clit got sucked into the cap, enough for the suction to be strong enough that it held onto my labia as I screamed and jumped off him.  The bottle dangled for less than a second until he grabbed the bottle and pulled it off my skin.\n\nI now have a small, hickey like bruise on my labia, and the plastic caused my clit to bleed a little bit. We sobered up real quick, I fell asleep crying with my boyfriend rubbing my back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Boyfriend got too close using the lube, clit got vacuumed into the 7th gate of hell.",

            "text": "Honestly I didn't wanted to get involved in the hate train for this game but today I lost it. Everyone is going around with their 2 shot explosive duped guns, while I'm constantly trying to get one. Hours of my life wasted on trying to get that powerful gun so I can finally be able to kill high level enemies. I miss the good old days of Fallout 4 where It didn't matter if u had a legendary effect on you're weapon or not. Enemies were not bullet sponges, It didn't take me hundreds of bullets just to kill a flying creature, and I'm level 67 my best weapon is the \"All Rise\" which I got from a quest and that was it, every legendary was ether wooden armor or raider armor. I don't think all the glitches are the problem of the game but the gun system, and yes I know that there has to be some kind of a balance in the game but that is ridiculous. Every time I go and play this game I end up frustrated about how good it could've been, all the good ideas wasted. I'm done with the game no matter how big the patches are, how many game modes they add etc. Maybe if they add that offline mode, that they've promised, maybe then the game will be playable on a level where people would return just for the story, which is decent half of the time. Well this took some time to write (my first post here) thanks if you managed to read it through the end. ",

We had both been thinking about it for a while now, as it would be a new experience for us. \n\nSo I went to the store to get the necessities, make sure we'd be protected from any unwanted new guests.\n\nFast forward to about 3 hours later. Me and her are getting ready to spice things up. However, onve we start doing the deed, my gf realises something - I bought the wrong sauce! She had always told me she liked the great value spaghetti sauce, and not the Prego sauce. I must've gotten the wrong jar, especially since I got mild sauce instead of the spicy sausage one. \n\nTL;DR: Me and my gf are about to have a great meal for a date, I got the wrong sauce that tasted awful to the both of us, date was ruined.",

Please remember that mobile gatcha games are NOT designed to be played for hours on end day in and day out unless you're a mega whale. If you're unhappy about the recent patch changes, perhaps you should reconsider your gaming habits.  \n\n\nHunts are not meant to be quick gear ups. Hunts are you medium term, medium investment events that give you gear over a \"medium\" lentgh of time. Or, depending on your teams, that could be Abyss.   \n\n\nReddit is a really negative place most of the time, and this sub had been pretty up and up until recently. People feel intitled to complain about every little thing, but keep in mind, this is a FREE game. If you don't like certain changes, just sit on your hands for a week and see how it goes instead of crying to the Internet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI like this game.",

It felt even better pointing it at a whole group of things and watching them all die at once. I myself have an explosive shotgun which I will be using far less often now so I know. What I also know is that being able to do any of that is and should not be fucking normal. \n\nWhat you're experiencing now with enemies actually needing to be shot multiple times is how this shit is supposed to work. Having to watch your ammo consumption, worry about crafting new ammo and considering using a different weapon when something is taking too long to kill is how this is supposed to work. \n\nJust because enemies take more than a single shot to kill now does not suddenly mean they have all become bullet sponges.  Having to shoot a high level armored enemy multiple times to kill them is normal. This is a survival shooter, you should be using up your ammo, you shouldn't be running around within thousands and thousands of rounds of bullets just from looting. Running low on ammo is normal.\n\nStop trying to argue that having to spend time shooting shit in a shooter is grindy. It's kind of a core concept of the game. \n\n",

I've never heard of any transgender wrestlers up until like early last year and I wanted to start finding out how I can start but I want to feel comfortable with someone who can train me properly I live in Philadelphia and I was looking at schools in NJ where Big Show trained at the Monster Factory and I was looking at the Wrestling Factory but I don't know if I can be able to afford that but currently I'm a barista at Starbucks been so for almost a yr and a half.

I played the VIP demo (preordered it on a whim) mainly because I was bored and Destiny and the division were games I wanted to like but could never get into. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI went in with mostly no expectations other than getting a weekends worth of fun being Iron man and then canceling my preorder. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell. Suffice it to say. I'm not canceling my preorder. The game (once I got into it) was pretty darn fun. It may be a shallow reason, but even if the game content isn't revolutionary, the flying and playing 4 different javelins is enough to make me keep playing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been in research mode ever since the weekend. Reading up all I can, watching any video I can find and honestly it's been a breath of fresh air to see the transparency and effort Bioware has put in. I've watched the negative videos too like heelsvsbaby face and the quartering on youtube, bashing Anthem for their micro transactions and their terrible demo and I realized. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet them have their transactions. IF, and a big IF, they follow through with what they are saying, that content will be updated for free, the game will be supported for a long time, there will be no \"annual pass\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf there are people willing to spend that money... let them. It's not predatory, it's not shady, its purely cosmetic and in the end they are a company that needs to make money. continued support, especially continued FREE support, isn't cheap. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yea, maybe 20 dollars is a little high, but eventually you can earn it for free. And I highly doubt these prices will stick. I ave a feeling they will drop. And the important part is that there are no pay to win loot boxes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the end, cosmetics are cosmetics, earning them should take some time in a game that's meant to last and if we could earn new cosmetic sets every week or two in game.... it would just over saturate the market with everyone looking the same. At least this way people will pick and choose and have something to save their in game currency for. Not to mention I'd rather have the dev team working on worthwhile content than trying to keep designing new cosmetic items to keep up with people buying them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust my two cents. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFYI I dont agree with a lot of micro transactions and I think that most of them are predatory and BS, but anthems seem reasonable.

            "text": "I feel they did the fans wrong. Here is why:\n\nStory:\n\n* It felt a bit rushed and a bit selfish to not bring the Sora and Kairi story line to a conclusion. Not having them meet up and kiss. Doing this type of thing on the first game, alright. Doing it on the second game, kinda bullshit. Doing it on the third game? Nah fam. You fucked up.\n\n* The first 3/4 of the game is very lacking on story and mostly just going around the Disney worlds leveling up. You don't even really get to the last bit of story until the last 4-6 hours and that's it. It just seems like Disney wanted to promote their assets.\n\nWorld building:\n\n* Not revisiting worlds seems bad. It's like you don't get to see the impact. It felt like you had little impact. Remember revisiting Agrabah after Jasmine had been taken? Remember the secret boss there?\n\nGameplay:\n\n* Way too many attractions. Like way to many.\n\n* The game is easy even on proud mode. I saw someone beat the game in 20 hours and there are 11 hours of cut scenes. That is major yikes from me.\n\nShilling for other games:\n\n* I did not agree with the promotion of the other probably failed game before Toy Box. It seemed bitter. I also did not like how the secret ending seems to possibly be promoting another non KH game somehow? I have seen speculation on it.\n\nAll and all, the game did not give us the final conclusion did not have interesting game play, and mostly reused Disney assets for all their worlds. I would not rate this game higher than 4/10. You could lump a few of the movie scenes on the end of the other games and get the exact same effect.",

            "text": "I keep reading here that fruits are so good, everyone eats fruits all the time.\n\nI just came back from 6 months in Japan where fruit is seen either a dessert or a gift. ***Fruit in Japan*** literally occupies the place that ***Cake in America*** does \u2014 and is viewed as such. It is also prohibitively expensive to go about snacking on all day. \n\nI had no ill experiences foregoing fruit \u2014 I replaced all instances where fruit would have gone into my diet with other non-sweet snacks, like dried fish or vegetables (so did others, even though there were plenty of options for sweeter alternatives like candy and soda, in abundance).\n\nSo, why the cult-like following of fruit from everyone here? It contains no better nutrients than vegetables and normalizes a sweet-tooth. Saying that fruit is part of a balanced diet also opens up for nonsense like \"no added sugars\" but having lots of sugary fruit juice as a sweetener. \n\nTL;DR \u2014 Why is fruit not seen as candy? That's basically what the Japanese dietary guidelines puts it as (to be consumed occasionally and with moderation)\n\nEDIT: I'm really getting that this is a sensitive topic. But I don't get why... Another point to discuss is how the USDA recommends up to ~1/4 of your plate being fruit. That's not \"moderation\" by any means..\n\nEDIT 2: Wow, this is crazy sensitive. The top comment is \"It's just fruit dude\". That's so much of a nonanswer that it really does seem like people are obsessed and don't want to talk about it. What is not better about vegetables replacing fruit when we have pretty much all the benefits (phytonutrients and fiber), and none of the drawbacks (sugar)? People have never eaten as much fruit in any society as we in the West do now.",

No other mmo that I have played lets a group of 5 or six people just stand around and kill the end game boss in less that a minute. you are supposed to use strategy and build diversity and healer to beat the boss over time. I think people have gotten too used to the game being easy. That's why they are complaining about lack of end game so early in the games life. No one should have been lvl100 coming out of the beta. progressing too fast is the problem. ",

People not yet comfortable using voices and 1st person  RP. The DM unsure about the exact implementation of a rule. AND really epic game play that was totally engaging. \n\nI felt like I was at the table with you, just waiting for my initiative round. \n\n\nEdit: forgive me all you I\u2019ve offended by using the word \u201creal.\u201d I did not mean your games are \u201cfake\u201d or \u201cimaginary.\u201d \ud83d\ude42 I meant that this is what D&D looks like for many of us.

Her jumping from mid 30s in Cyl 2 to top 5 in Cyl 3 is really abnormal, unless you count a certain big youtuber who doesn\u2019t even play the game rallying behind her. Imo I\u2019m glad the winners were actually picked by the Feh community (at least Camilla has been consistently making top 5) and not some outside source.\n",

But even more interesting is if they can convince the Warriors to take back Hardaway Jr and Lee's expiring + a 1st for Durant... if the Warriors are losing Durant anyways, they'd probably be better off agreeing to a s&T.  That could put the Mavs in position to add multiple stars to pair with Luka and Zinger.  \n\n",
